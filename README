# Data Structures in Go (Golang)

This project provides a comprehensive collection of data structures implemented in Go (Golang). The repository is organized into two main categories: built-in data structures provided by Go itself and user-defined data structures that can be implemented using Go's features such as slices, maps, and structs.

## Built-in Data Structures

- **Arrays**: Fixed-size collections of items of the same type, useful when the number of elements is known a priority.
- **Slices**: Dynamic arrays that can grow or shrink, offering flexibility and convenience over traditional arrays.
- **Maps**: Unordered collections of key-value pairs, ideal for fast retrieval based on unique keys.
- **Channels**: Conduits for communication between goroutines, facilitating concurrent programming.
- **Strings**: Immutable sequences of bytes, most commonly used to handle textual data.

## User-defined Data Structures

- **Structs**: Custom-defined types that bundle together different data types under a single name.
- **Linked Lists**: A sequence of nodes where each node points to the next, allowing for efficient element insertion and removal.
- **Trees**: Structures that organize data hierarchically, including binary trees, AVL trees, and red-black trees.
- **Heaps**: Specialized tree-based structures that implement priority queues.
- **Graphs**: Representations of networks consisting of nodes interconnected by edges.
- **Stacks**: Last-in-first-out data structures for managing elements in a reversed sequence.
- **Queues**: First-in-first-out data structures for processing elements in the order they were added.
- **Ring Buffers**: Fixed-size buffers that operate in a circular manner, useful in scenarios where a buffer is continuously filled and emptied.
- **Sets**: Collections that ensure all elements are distinct.
- **Tries**: Variant of trees that store associative arrays or dynamic sets where keys are typically strings.
- **Hash Tables**: Implementations that may use custom hash functions and strategies for collision resolution.

## Concurrency Considerations

When implementing data structures in Go, it's crucial to handle concurrency with care, particularly if a data structure will be accessed by multiple goroutines. This project emphasizes thread-safe implementation and provides examples of using channels, mutexes, and other synchronization techniques.
